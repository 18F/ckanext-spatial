ckanext-spatial - Geo related plugins for CKAN
==============================================

This extension contains plugins that add geospatial capabilities to CKAN.
The following plugins are currently available:

* Spatial model for CKAN datasets and automatic geo-indexing (``spatial_metadata``)
* Spatial Search - Spatial search integration and API call (``spatial_query``).
* Spatial Search Widget - Map widget integrated on the search form (``spatial_query_widget``).
* Dataset Extent Map - Map widget showing a dataset extent (``dataset_extent_map``).
* WMS Preview - a Web Map Service (WMS) previewer (``wms_preview``).
* CSW Server - a basic CSW server - to server metadata from the CKAN instance (``cswserver``)
* GEMINI Harvesters - for importing INSPIRE-style metadata into CKAN (``gemini_csw_harvester``, ``gemini_doc_harvester``, ``gemini_waf_harvester``)
* Harvest Metadata API - a way for a user to view the harvested metadata XML, either as a raw file or styled to view in a web browser. (``spatial_harvest_metadata_api``)

These libraries:

* CSW Client - a basic client for accessing a CSW server
* Validators - uses XSD / Schematron to validate geographic metadata XML. Used by the GEMINI Harvesters
* Validators for ISO19139/INSPIRE/GEMINI2 metadata. Used by the Validator.

And these command-line tools:

* cswinfo - a command-line tool to help making requests of any CSW server

As of October 2012, ckanext-csw and ckanext-inspire were merged into this extension.
